      <li><h3>About me :</h3></li>
      <p>
        Hi ,I am Aakash Karthikeyan ,I was born on 11-JULY-2003 on Hydrebad and
        later moved on to Karaikal(current city). I am more of a curious person
        and a big Introvert,I hate when it is crowded around me or when multiple
        persons are looking at me,I hate drawing attention towards me so I
        always stay quiet and calm in the class without interacting with anyone
        .If you look at me and my facial appearence then you might think I am
        some middle aged dude but trust me I am the youngest person in my whole
        class who was born on july 2003.I am a Lazy person ,even now I feel lazy
        to type about me......
      </p>
      <li><h3>Education :</h3></li>
      <p>
        I completed my Higher Secondary from Cauvery Public School Karaikal with
        a score of 70% in 12th std.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Electronics And
        Communication Engineering in Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College.
        I currently have a total CGPA of 6.95 till 6th semester.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Favourite foods</h3></li>
      <p>
        I like spicy foods and at the same time I Like sweet foods too. Dark
        Chocolates are one of my favourites and I always buy dark chocolates or
        dairy milks and keep on eating them. I like Biriyani.Who doesnt like
        Biriyni?? Everyone likes it. I am a hostel student for the past 3 years
        so i miss my mother's home made cooking. Now i dont even want to eat any
        fast foods or cool drinks or anything else but i just want to eat my
        mother's cooking.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Favourite games</h3></li>
      <p>
        I am a introvert so you could guess what my favourite games are.Its
        obvious ,they are video games and online multiplayer games
      </p>
      <p>
        My first video game experience was on Nitendo Gameboy advance sp which I
        got from my parents when I was Like 6-7.I played lots of games on it and
        you could consider that my addiction to video games came from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting my first laptop on 10th std,I was more into PC games like
        Gta,Asphalt,Roblox,etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        Then later i switched to online multiplayer games like PUBG,CALL OF
        DUTY,FORTNITE,etc..These were the best games i ever came across.Two
        years of lockdown due to covid ran fast because of them.The thing about
        online multiplayer games is you could interact with lots and lots of
        people of different age,gender,religion,culture,countries,etc.. just by
        voice chat while playing with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got so many online friends in which few were super awesome and
        moreover i learned to speak fluently in different languages because of
        them.I learned to speak fluently in HINDI,TELUGU,MALAYALAM,TAMIL.Its
        been five years since they became my friends and even now we play
        together on weekends and holidays.
      </p>

      </p>
      <li><h3>What I dont like to do :</h3></li>
      <p>
        I hate it when people force me to do something like its Right or Wrong,I
        have my own ideals and beliefs and I dont want others to complain about
        it.
